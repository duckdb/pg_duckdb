      description: |
        Please provide steps to reproduce the behavior, preferably a [minimal reproducible example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example). Please adhere the following guidelines:

        * Format the code and the output as [code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) using triple backticks:

          ````
          ```
          CODE HERE
          ```
          ````
        * Remove all prompts from the scripts. This include DuckDB's 'D' prompt and Python's `>>>` prompt. Removing these prompts makes reproduction attempts quicker.
        * Make sure that the script and its outputs are provided in separate code blocks.

# pg_duckdb: Official Postgres extension for DuckDB

pg_duckdb is a Postgres extension that embeds DuckDB's columnar-vectorized analytics engine and features into Postgres. We recommend using pg_duckdb to build high performance analytics and data-intensive applications.

pg_duckdb was developed in collaboration with our partners, [Hydra][] and [MotherDuck][].

## Features

See our [official documentation][docs] for further details.

- `SELECT` queries executed by the DuckDB engine can directly read Postgres tables. (If you only query Postgres tables you need to run `SET duckdb.force_execution TO true`, see the **IMPORTANT** section above for details)
	- Able to read [data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html) that exist in both Postgres and DuckDB. The following data types are supported: numeric, character, binary, date/time, boolean, uuid, json, domain, and arrays.
	- If DuckDB cannot support the query for any reason, execution falls back to Postgres.
- Read and Write support for object storage (AWS S3, Azure, Cloudflare R2, or Google GCS):
	- Read parquet, CSV and JSON files:
		- `SELECT * FROM read_parquet('s3://bucket/file.parquet')`
		- `SELECT r['id'], r['name'] FROM read_csv('s3://bucket/file.csv') r`
		- `SELECT count(*) FROM read_json('s3://bucket/file.json')`
		- You can pass globs and arrays to these functions, just like in DuckDB
	- Enable the DuckDB Iceberg extension using `SELECT duckdb.install_extension('iceberg')` and read Iceberg files with `iceberg_scan`.
	- Enable the DuckDB Delta extension using `SELECT duckdb.install_extension('delta')` and read Delta files with `delta_scan`.
	- Write a query â€” or an entire table â€” to parquet in object storage.
		- `COPY (SELECT foo, bar FROM baz) TO 's3://...'`
		- `COPY table TO 's3://...'`
		- Read and write to Parquet format in a single query

			```sql
			COPY (
				SELECT count(*), r['name']
				FROM read_parquet('s3://bucket/file.parquet') r
				GROUP BY name
				ORDER BY count DESC
			) TO 's3://bucket/results.parquet';
			```
- Read and Write support for data stored in MotherDuck
- Query and `JOIN` data in object storage/MotherDuck with Postgres tables, views, and materialized views.
- Create temporary tables in DuckDB its columnar storage format using `CREATE TEMP TABLE ... USING duckdb`.
- Install DuckDB extensions using `SELECT duckdb.install_extension('extension_name');`
- Toggle DuckDB execution on/off with a setting:
	- `SET duckdb.force_execution = true|false`
- Cache remote object locally for faster execution using `SELECT duckdb.cache('path', 'type');` where
	- 'path' is HTTPFS/S3/GCS/R2 remote object
	- 'type' specify remote object type: 'parquet' or 'csv'

## Installation

### Docker

Docker images are [available on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pgduckdb/pgduckdb) and are based on the official Postgres image. Use of this image is [the same as the Postgres image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/). For example, you can run the image directly:

```shell
docker run -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=duckdb pgduckdb/pgduckdb:16-main
```

And with MotherDuck, you only need a [a MotherDuck access token][md-access-token] and then it is as simple as:
```shell
$ export MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN=<your personal MD token>
$ docker run -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=duckdb -e MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN pgduckdb/pgduckdb:16-main -c duckdb.motherduck_enabled=true
```

Or you can use the docker compose in this repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/duckdb/pg_duckdb && cd pg_duckdb && docker compose up -d
```

Once started, connect to the database using psql:

```shell
psql postgres://postgres:duckdb@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres
# Or if using docker compose
docker compose exec db psql
```

For other usages see our [Docker specific README][docker readme].

[docker readme]: https://github.com/duckdb/pg_duckdb/blob/main/docker/README.md
### pgxman (apt)

Pre-built apt binaries are [available via pgxman](https://pgx.sh/pg_duckdb). After installation, you will need to add pg_duckdb to `shared_preload_libraries` and create the extension.

```shell
pgxman install pg_duckdb
```

Note: due to the use of `shared_preload_libraries`, pgxman's container support is not currently compatible with pg_duckdb.

### Compile from source

To build pg_duckdb, you need:

* Postgres 14-17
* Ubuntu 22.04-24.04 or MacOS
* Standard set of build tools for building Postgres extensions
* [Build tools that are required to build DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/dev/building/build_instructions)

To build and install, run:

```sh
make install
```

Add `pg_duckdb` to the `shared_preload_libraries` in your `postgresql.conf` file:

```ini
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_duckdb'
```

Next, create the `pg_duckdb` extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_duckdb;
```

**IMPORTANT:** DuckDB execution is usually enabled automatically when needed. It's enabled whenever you use DuckDB functions (such as `read_csv`), when you query DuckDB tables, and when running `COPY table TO 's3://...'`. However, if you want queries which only touch Postgres tables to use DuckDB execution you need to run `SET duckdb.force_execution TO true`'. This feature is _opt-in_ to avoid breaking existing queries. To avoid doing that for every session, you can configure it for a certain user by doing `ALTER USER my_analytics_user SET duckdb.force_execution TO true`.

## Getting Started

See our [official documentation][docs] for more usage information.

pg_duckdb relies on DuckDB's vectorized execution engine to read and write data to object storage bucket (AWS S3, Azure, Cloudflare R2, or Google GCS) and/or MotherDuck. The follow two sections describe how to get started with these destinations.

### Object storage bucket (AWS S3, Azure, Cloudflare R2, or Google GCS)

Querying data stored in Parquet, CSV, JSON, Iceberg and Delta format can be done with `read_parquet`, `read_csv`, `read_json`, `iceberg_scan` and `delta_scan` respectively.

1. Add a credential to enable DuckDB's httpfs support.

	```sql
	-- Session Token is Optional
	INSERT INTO duckdb.secrets
	(type, key_id, secret, session_token, region)
	VALUES ('S3', 'access_key_id', 'secret_access_key', 'session_token', 'us-east-1');
	```

2. Copy data directly to your bucket - no ETL pipeline!

	```sql
	COPY (SELECT user_id, item_id, price, purchased_at FROM purchases)
	TO 's3://your-bucket/purchases.parquet;
	```

3. Perform analytics on your data.

	```sql
	SELECT SUM(r['price']) AS total, r['item_id']
	FROM read_parquet('s3://your-bucket/purchases.parquet') r
	GROUP BY item_id
	ORDER BY total DESC
	LIMIT 100;
	```

Note, for Azure, you may store a secret using the `connection_string` parameter as such:
```sql
INSERT INTO duckdb.secrets
(type, connection_string)
VALUES ('Azure', '<your connection string>');
```

Note: writes to Azure are not yet supported, please see [the current discussion](duckdb/duckdb_azure#44) for more information.

### Connect with MotherDuck

pg_duckdb also integrates with [MotherDuck][md]. To enable this support you first need to [generate an access token][md-access-token] and then add the following line to your `postgresql.conf` file:

```ini
duckdb.motherduck_token = 'your_access_token'
```

NOTE: If you don't want to store the token in your `postgresql.conf`file can also store the token in the `motherduck_token` environment variable and then explicitly enable MotherDuck support in your `postgresql.conf` file:

```ini
duckdb.motherduck_enabled = true
```

If you installed `pg_duckdb` in a different Postgres database than the default one named `postgres`, then you also need to add the following line to your `postgresql.conf` file:

```ini
duckdb.motherduck_postgres_database = 'your_database_name'
```

The default MotherDuck database will be easiest to use (see below for details), by default this is `my_db`. If you want to specify which MotherDuck database is your default database, then you can also add the following line to your `postgresql.conf` file:

```ini
duckdb.motherduck_default_database = 'your_motherduck_database_name'
```

After doing this (and possibly restarting Postgres). You can then you create tables in the MotherDuck database by using the `duckdb` [Table Access Method][tam] like this:
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders(id bigint, item text, price NUMERIC(10, 2)) USING duckdb;
CREATE TABLE users_md_copy USING duckdb AS SELECT * FROM users;
```

[tam]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tableam.html


Any tables that you already had in MotherDuck are automatically available in Postgres. Since DuckDB and MotherDuck allow accessing multiple databases from a single connection and Postgres does not, we map database+schema in DuckDB to a schema name in Postgres.

This is done in the following way:
1. Each schema in your default MotherDuck database (see above on how to specify which database is the default) are simply merged with the Postgres schemas with the same name.
2. Except for the `main` DuckDB schema in your default database, which is merged with the Postgres `public` schema.
3. Tables in other databases are put into dedicated DuckDB-only schemas. These schemas are of the form `ddb$<duckdb_db_name>$<duckdb_schema_name>` (including the literal `$` characters).
4. Except for the `main` schema in those other databases. That schema should be accessed using the shorter name `ddb$<db_name>` instead.

An example of each of these cases is shown below:

```sql
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (1, 'abc'); -- inserts into my_db.main.my_table
INSERT INTO your_schema.tab1 VALUES (1, 'abc'); -- inserts into my_db.your_schema.tab1
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ddb$my_shared_db.aggregated_order_data; -- reads from my_shared_db.main.aggregated_order_data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ddb$sample_data$hn.hacker_news; -- reads from sample_data.hn.hacker_news
```

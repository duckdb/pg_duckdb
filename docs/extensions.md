# pg_duckdb Extensions

The following extensions are installed by default:

* httpfs - note that httpfs was forked to add [`duckdb.cache`](functions.md#cache)
* json

Supported extensions for installation are:

* iceberg

Installing other extensions may work, but is at your own risk.

## Installing an extension

Installing an extension requires superuser.

```sql
SELECT duckdb.install_extension('extname');
```

## Implementation

Installing an extension causes it to be loaded and installed globally for any connection that uses DuckDB. The current list of installed extensions is maintained in the `duckdb.extensions` table. Superusers can use this table to view, disable, or uninstall extensions, as follows:

```sql
-- Install an extension
SELECT duckdb.install_extension('iceberg');
-- view currently installed extensions
SELECT * FROM duckdb.extensions;
-- disable or enable an extension
UPDATE duckdb.extensions SET enabled = (false|true) WHERE name = 'iceberg';
-- remove an extension
DELETE FROM duckdb.extensions WHERE name = 'iceberg';
```

There is currently no practical difference between a disabled and uninstalled extension.

## Supported Extensions

### `iceberg`

Iceberg support adds functions to read iceberg tables and metadata. For a list of iceberg functions, see [pg_duckdb Functions](functions.md).

# 0.2.0 (2024-12-10)

## Added

- Support for reading Delta Lake storage using the `duckdb.delta_scan(...)` function. ([#403])
- Support for reading JSON using the `duckdb.read_json(...)` function. ([#405])
- Support for multi-statement transactions. ([#433])
- Support reading from Azure Blob storage. ([#478])
- Support many more array types, such as `float` , `numeric` and `uuid` arrays. ([#282])
- Support for PostgreSQL 14. ([#397])
- Manage cached files using the `duckdb.cache_info()` and `duckdb.cache_delete()` functions. ([#434])
- Add `scope` column to `duckdb.secrets` table. ([#461])
- Allow configuring the default MotherDuck database using the `duckdb.motherduck_default_database` setting. ([#470])
- Automatically install and load known DuckDB extensions when queries use them. So, `duckdb.install_extension()` is usually not necessary anymore. ([#484])

## Changed

- Improve performance of heap reading. ([#366])
- Bump DuckDB version to 1.1.3. ([#400])

## Fixed

- Throw a clear error when reading partitioned tables (reading from partitioned tables is not supported yet). ([#412])
- Fixed crash when using `CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION`. ([#423])
- Fix queries inserting into DuckDB tables with `DEFAULT` values. ([#448])
- Fixed assertion failure involving recursive CTEs. ([#436])
- Only allow setting `duckdb.motherduck_postgres_database` in `postgresql.conf`. ([#476])
- Much better separation between C and C++ code, to avoid memory leaks and crashes (many PRs).
